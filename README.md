# Web Scraping Project with Scrapy and MongoDB


## Overview

This project showcases a successful web scraping endeavor using the Scrapy framework and MongoDB as the storage solution, with some help from BeautifulSoup. The goal was to extract structured data from websites and store it in a MongoDB database for further analysis.

## Features

- Utilized Scrapy, a powerful and flexible web scraping framework, to automate data extraction from target websites.
- Leveraged MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and manage the collected data with ease.
- Implemented custom Scrapy pipelines to clean and preprocess the scraped data before storage.
- Achieved efficient and reliable data scraping using Scrapy's built-in features like automatic request throttling.


## Results

The scraped data is stored in my MongoDB database as structured documents, ready for further analysis and insights.
